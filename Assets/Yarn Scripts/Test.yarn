None: You walk towards the back of the house and grab the cool handle of the sliding glass door. As you pull it open, the winter wind rushes in and bites at your skin.
None: The garden has wilted by now, but the landscaping brings a smile to your face. At the corner of your eye, a bush rustles. Another cool gust of wind and a ghost appears.
G: Oh! H-hi! I didn’t know we’d have visitors.
You: Hi, I’m X’s grandchild. I’m here for the summer to help clean up the place.
G: I’m Gertrude! And what do you mean “clean up”? Is it not clean enough? 
You: Well, I just need to tidy before we sell. Speaking of, the garden is not quite how I remember. Where are the herbs and veggies?
G: I tried keeping up the garden, but I don’t have the green thumb she did. I don’t really have thumbs at all anymore. Hehehe.
You: What have you tried planting?
G: Do you know beets?
You: Yeah, she would pickle beets for us as kids. :)
G: Well not those.
You: Oh.
