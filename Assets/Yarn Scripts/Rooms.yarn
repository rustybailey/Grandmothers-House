Shelby: Ahhhh! Put that away!
You: What? The movie?
Shelby: Yes! How can you watch stuff like that?
You: Well, I wasn’t watching it. I was just looking.
Shelby: Yeah... but still.
You: Do you not like scary movies?
Shelby: No, those are just awful.
You: It’s funny. These old ones are kind of comforting. My grandmother used to tape them off TV and we’d watch them when I came over.
Shelby: And they didn’t scare you?
You: Oh yeah, I was scarred for life. But... I look back on those times fondly.
Shelby: Fondly?
You: Yeah, despite the fact that they were scary movies, that was our time. I’ll always cherish that.
Shelby: <size="40%"><wave>weirdo</wave></size>
You: Wait. How can you be so scared? Aren’t you a ghost?
Shelby: Yes! And it’s terrifying!
You: Terrifying?
Shelby: I get frightened everytime I look in the mirror!
You: Maybe don’t look in a mirror?
Shelby: What about other reflective surfaces? I can’t escape me! I live my entire afterlife in absolute terror!
You: Ok, calm down.
Shelby: <shake>DON’T TELL ME TO BE CALM!</shake>
You: ...
Shelby: ... Sorry, lost it a bit there.
You: You sure did.
Shelby: So what are you here for anyways? I thought we had this place to ourselves now.
You: Well, I’ve been sent to clean the place before we sell it...
Shelby: Bummer. Can I still live here?
You: I guess?
Shelby: Were you looking for something?
You: Actually, I'm trying to find her famous cookie recipe.
Shelby: Oh, those smelled so nice!
You: Do you remember where she kept it?
Shelby: No, but I’ve heard Victor does.
You: The ghost that can singe your nose hairs?
Shelby: That’s the one! You must have heard of him.
You: Yeah, Frankie mentioned him.
You: Ok, I guess I’ll try to find him. Thanks for the chat.
Shelby: Cya later!

Narration: You walk into the kitchen. The light shines through the window over the sink, illuminating the dust on the countertops.
Narration: You see stray crumbs from past cookies that once provided comfort. Shame the recipe isn’t with them.
Narration: You start to look through the cabinets above the stove and see a variety of mugs ranging from theme park memorabilia to limited edition glassware.
<<show_item Cup>>
<<play_sfx CeramicCup>>
Narration: In the top left, there’s the mug you made her when you were a child. It’s a bit yellowed due to the years of coffee stains. Years of love?
Narration: Then, a crack. A bang.
Narration: And... the sound of sand? No, coffee grounds on the floor, tipping out of an empty bag.

You: <shake>A GHOST?!?</shake>
Frankie: You should see your face.
Frankie: Look in a mirror. It’s great. (laughing)
You: Who are you?
Frankie: You can call me Frankie.
Frankie: Did you say you can’t see yourself? Are you... are you a ghost too?
You: I never said that.
Frankie: <wiggle>Pranksssss!</wiggle> (cackling) Oh man, another win for me. You were scared. Absolutely scared.
You: No... I was just exclaiming a fact. Loudly.
Frankie: Hey, don’t try to steal my thunder. You’re Grammy G’s kid?
You: No, grandkid.
Frankie: Kid’s kid? Wow, so you must be a baby.
You: That’s not very nice.
Frankie: Just <wiggle>pranksssss</wiggle>. I’m full of jokes.
You: ...
Frankie: Whatever. Nobody has a sense of humor anymore. Not like Grammy G did, anyway. The other ghosts don’t get it.
You: There are other ghosts?!
Frankie: Eh, they’re livin’ in Snoozeville, if you know what I mean.
You: I don’t.
Frankie: Figures.
You: So, the ghosts?
Frankie: Some of them pull lame pranks. Big deal. But not like THIS!
You: Did you just spill more coffee beans?
Frankie: Classic (wiping away tear)
You: You must be the "funny" ghost.
Frankie: Wow, that’s... wow. Yes. Yes I am.
Frankie: Watch out for Victor though. One time he disappeared for a decade. Weird, but hilarious.
-> Did you prank grandmother?
    Frankie: Oh, she loved it! We had a blast. That woman could take a joke and give them right back.
    Frankie: One time, she put the coffee grounds in the wrong place so I couldn’t knock them over. I mean, what a genius! Almost stumped me with that one.
    Narration: You look up at the mug again. You notice a slight crack is in the side.
    You: Did you break that?
    Frankie: No, she really liked that mug. Always had it with cookies and milk.
    Narration: You look at the mug in the cabinet again.
    Frankie: ...yeah, okay, I broke the mug. I felt bad, but I didn’t mean to.
-> Did... you die here?
    Frankie: No, a coffee hazard got me.
    You: Coffee hazard?
    Frankie: Yup. Got burnt... to death.
    You: Oh God.
    Frankie: Yeah, not the most pleasant way to go, but I died doing what I love.
    You: Drinking coffee?
    Frankie: No, drinking coffee while driving my motorcycle!
    You: I don't think it was the coffee that killed you.
    Frankie: Yup, pretty sure it was a coffee burn.
You: Do you know where she kept that cookie recipe?
Frankie: I ripped it up.
You: <shake>WHAT?</shake>
Frankie: Kidding! <wiggle>Prankssss</wiggle>.
You: So do you know where it is?
Frankie: No, but you might want to look for Victor. I bet he has an idea of where it could be.
You: Who is that?
Frankie: A super-old, smelly ghost.
You: That's it?
Frankie: Yeah, but it's real bad. Like hot garbage and toe jam.
You: That shouldn't be hard to miss.
// You: By the way, we're selling the house...
// Frankie: Hilarious!
// You: No, really.
// Frankie: Wow. Dang. I guess it’ll be time for me to move on then.
// You: I’m sorry.
// Frankie: GOTCHA. <wiggle>Pranks!</wiggle> I’m staying here forever!
Frankie: If your nose hairs are tingling, you're getting closer.
You: Is... my Grandma a ghost here?
Frankie: Awk-ward. Listen, if you’re looking for Grammy G, she isn’t here.
Frankie: Consider it a good thing. She had no unfinished business.
// Frankie: Can you imagine? Maybe I’d be able to eat those cookies instead of just smelling them.
You: Yeah, I guess so.
You: Well I’m gonna go look for the recipe.
Frankie: Say hi to Victor for me!

Narration: Grandma’s bedroom is exactly how she left it. The crocheted blanket is folded at the end of the quilted comforter.
Narration: On the bedside table, you see a picture of Grandma and Grandpa on their wedding day.
<<show_item Photo>>
<<play_sfx PickUpBook>>
<<wait 2>>
Narration: They look so young. So happy. You wonder if they look the same now that they’re back together…
Narration: There’s a stack of photo albums littered on the floor. It echoes memories of her flipping through them with you as a child.
Narration: She always said you looked like your grandfather. You always said you looked more like her. Floating over an open photo album is another ghost.

<<set_active_character Edith>>
<<play_sfx GhostFadeIn>>
Edith: You’re not here to take the albums, are you?
You: At some point, yeah.
Edith: Then I’d like one last look at them. They looked so happy.
Edith: I liked it when she was happy. I just want people to be happy.
You: Are you happy?
Edith: I'm a ghost. I make do.
You: Why do you care about these pictures?
Edith: They might be worth a lot of money now.
You: Uh… I think those are just wedding pictures.
Edith: They might be displayed in a museum. The High. The Louvre. I don’t know which I’d give it to. Choices, choices…
You: Sorry, are these yours?
Edith: Well, of course!
-> You photographed her wedding?
    Edith: Yes, she was one of my best friends. She gave me my first wedding gig.
    You: Oh, that's awesome!
    Edith: I clearly had no idea what I was doing when I photographed her wedding, but I’ve improved by leaps and bounds.
    Narration: You look at the photo album dated many years after their wedding. Some are blurred or off center. One looks like it might have a thumb in the corner of the frame.
    You: What do you remember about Grandma?
    Edith: She was the nicest person I knew. Never had a bad thing to say about anyone.
    You: That sounds like her.
-> Did you do other photography?
    Edith: I was known for my bird photography.
    You: Oh, that's cool. What was your favorite bird?
    Edith: The pigeon.
    You: That doesn't seem very exotic.
    Edith: No, but it's all I had access to.
    You: So you were a pigeon photographer?
    Edith: I mean, that's not the only thing I photographed.
    You: ...
    Edith: But yeah, I was known as the pigeon photographer.
Edith: Did you come in here for something?
You: Oh, right. I'm looking for her cookie recipe, actually.
Edith: Are you making those blueberry cookies she used to bake? Oh, you should. I always loved those. 
You: Yes! Do you know where the recipe is?
Edith: Victor may know. I can’t find anything around here. I can’t even find my camera.
You: The one around your neck?
Edith: No, no. It was a different one with a long lens.
You: When did you last see it?
Edith: Twenty years ago.
You: Oh.
Edith: I miss it.
You: ...
You: I miss her.
Edith: Me too.
Edith: I’m sorry for your loss.
You: ... Thanks.
Edith: You know, she was always good at comforting me when I’d lose things.
Edith: I bet you anything if you really put your heart into it, you could make those cookies yourself.
You: Hey, thanks. I bet you could find your camera.
Edith: No, that one is long gone. But we all need to move on eventually.
You: Yeah.
Edith: I’ll see you around.

Narration: You walk towards the back of the house and grab the cool handle of the sliding glass door. As you pull it open, the winter wind rushes in and bites at your skin.
Narration: The garden has wilted by now, but the landscaping brings a smile to your face. At the corner of your eye, a bush rustles. Another cool gust of wind and a ghost appears.

<<set_active_character Gertrude>>
<<play_sfx GhostFadeIn>>
Gertrude: Oh! H-hi! I didn’t know we'd have visitors.
You: Hi, I’m Grammy G’s grandchild. I’m here for the summer to help clean up the place.
Gertrude: I’m Gertrude! And what do you mean “clean up”? Is it not clean enough? 
You: Well, I just need to tidy before we put it on the market.
You: Speaking of, the garden is not quite how I remember. Where are the herbs and veggies?
Gertrude: I tried keeping up the garden, but I don’t have the green thumb she did. I don’t really have thumbs at all anymore. Hehehe.
You: What have you tried planting?
Gertrude: Do you know beets?
You: Yeah, she would pickle beets for us as kids. :)
Gertrude: Well not those.
You: Oh.
Gertrude: I’m trying to grow these blueberries that she would mix in her cookies.
You: Oh! I’m actually looking for that recipe. Do you happen to know where it is?
Gertrude: I don’t know what a recipe is, but I found this.
<<show_item Trowel>>
<<play_sfx Shovel>>
<<wait 1>>
You: Oh, wow! I remember getting her that for Christmas one year as a kid.
You: Mom told me later that she already had a better one, but she ended up using the one I got her all the time. Made me feel pretty good.
Gertrude: Nice.
You: Is it helping you with your gardening?
Gertrude: No, but I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong.
You: Well, it doesn’t help that you’re holding it upside down.
Gertrude: You know, I thought it had a wide handle.
You: Did you help my grandmother garden when she was alive?
Gertrude: I didn’t so much “help” as much as kill everything I laid my hands on.
You: Yeah, that doesn’t seem helpful.
Gertrude: And apparently ectoplasm isn’t good for plants.
You: Gross!
Gertrude: No one told me!
You: Why would someone need to tell you that?
Gertrude: Well, I used it didn’t I?
You: At least some things are living.
Gertrude: That one is fake. I needed a goal to work towards.
You: Have you gotten anything going yet?
Gertrude: Not in all my years!
You: ...
Gertrude: But ya know, your grandmother was always patient with me. I will miss our poor gardening activities.
You: Yeah... me too...
Gertrude: ...
Gertrude: Victor is not nearly as patient... He’s always mocking my plants.
You: Frankie mentioned him. Should I know anything before I meet him?
Gertrude: He's been here for hundreds of years. If anyone knows where the recipe is, he would?
You: Do you know where I could find him?
Gertrude: Just keep looking. He'll be lurking in some dark corner of the house.
You: Well, thanks for the tip. I'll keep an eye out.
Gertrude: Good luck!
