Narration: You wander into the living room. There are boxes of books and VHS tapes piled up next to the couch.
Narration: Grandma always liked recording reruns of horror movies. Your first nightmares came from those movie nights.
Narration: Ah, good times.
Narration: You pick up a tape with “Possessed Murder Doll” written on the side.

Shelby: Ahhhh! Put that away!
You: What? The movie?
Shelby: Yes! How can you watch stuff like that?
You: Do you not like scary movies?
Shelby: No, those are just awful.
You: Ha, I kinda like them, actually. Grandma and I would watch them together.
You: Sometimes she'd hide behind the couch and jump out.
Shelby: And that didn’t scare you?!
You: Oh yeah, I was scarred for life. But... it was nice. That was our thing.
Shelby: <size="40%"><wave>weirdos</wave></size>
You: Wait. How can you be so scared of these? Aren’t you a ghost?
Shelby: Yes! I get frightened everytime I look in the mirror!
You: Maybe don’t look in a mirror?
Shelby: What about other reflective surfaces? I can’t escape me! I live my entire afterlife in absolute terror!
You: Ok, calm down.
Shelby: <shake>DON’T TELL ME TO BE CALM!</shake>
You: ...
Shelby: ... Sorry, lost it a bit there.
-> Wow, that scared me.
    Shelby: <size="40%"><wave>don't remind me</wave></size>
-> Did you scare yourself? 
    Shelby: <size="40%"><wave>maybe</wave></size>
You: Well, I guess these movies will be out of your hair...er...wisps?
Shelby: Wisps is acceptable.
You: Okay, well... you won't have to worry about them anymore. I’ve been sent to clean the place before we sell it.
Shelby: Oh...c-can I still live here?
You: I guess? We don't really have to worry about you haunting it, I suppose.
Shelby: <size="40%"><wave>oh, the horror...</wave></size>
You: Anyway, I'm trying to find her cookie recipe. Do you know where she kept it?
Shelby: No, but... <shake>Victor</shake> should know.
You: I heard he smells.
Shelby: It's... haunting.
You: Right. Thanks for the chat.
Shelby: Wait! ...please take the movie with you!
Narration: You grab the movie. Shelby flinches.

Narration: You walk into the kitchen. The light shines through the window over the sink, illuminating the dust on the countertops.
Narration: You see stray crumbs from past cookies. Shame the recipe isn’t with them.
Narration: You start to look through the cabinets above the stove and see a variety of mugs ranging from theme park memorabilia to limited edition glassware.

You: <shake>WHAT!</shake>
Frankie: HA! Kidding! <wiggle>Pranksssss!</wiggle> Oh man, another win for me! You were scared. Absolutely scared.
You: No... I was just confused. Loudly.
Frankie: Sure. Well, what are ya doing here, kiddo?
-> Cleaning the house
    Frankie: Hey, we don't allow that talk here! Cleaning is for squares.
    You: I guess ghosts don't clean?
    Frankie: Cool ghosts don't.
    You: Well, I gotta get this place ready for sale.
    Frankie: Oh, right... Grammy G...
    You: Did you know my grandma?
    Frankie: Of course I did!
-> Ghost hunting
    Frankie: Hey, not funny! I'm the prankster here!
    Frankie: ...but, you're not really ghost hunting are you?
    You: No, this is actually my grandma's house.
Frankie: Grammy G! Wow, you must be her itty bitty grandbaby.
You: I'm not a... I mean, yes, I'm...
Frankie: Hey, it's cool, it's cool. Just <wiggle>pranksssss</wiggle>. I’m full of jokes.
You: ...
Frankie: Whatever. Nobody has a sense of humor anymore. The other ghosts don’t get it.
You: There are other ghosts?!
Frankie: Eh, they’re livin’ in Snoozeville, if you know what I mean.
-> I don’t.
    Frankie: Figures.
-> There are other ghosts?!
    Frankie: Heck yeah, daddy-o!
    Frankie: Some of them pull pranks too. But not like me. But not like THIS!
    <<play_sfx CoffeeBeans>>
    You: ...did you just spill more coffee beans?
    Frankie: Classic *wiping away tear*
You: So, you must be the "funny" ghost.
Frankie: Wow, that’s... wow. Yes. Yes I am. About time I'm appreciated for my talent!
-> Did you prank Grandma?
    Frankie: Of course! She loved pranking me too!
    Frankie: One time, she put the coffee grounds in the wrong place so I couldn’t knock them over. I mean, what a genius! Almost stumped me with that one.
    Narration: You look up at the mug again. You notice a slight crack is in the side.
    You: Did you break that?
    Frankie: I would never! She loved that mug.
    Narration: You look at the mug in the cabinet again.
    Frankie: ...yeah, okay, I broke the mug.
-> Did... you die here?
    Frankie: No, a coffee hazard got me.
    You: Coffee hazard?
    Frankie: Yup. Got burnt... to death.
    You: Oh God.
    Frankie: Nah, I died doing what I love.
    You: Drinking coffee?
    Frankie: No, drinking coffee while driving my motorcycle!
    You: Was that supposed to be another <wiggle>prank</wiggle>?
    Frankie: ...no. Insensitive.
You: Right. So, I'm actually looking for her cookie recipe. Do you know where she kept it?
Frankie: I ripped it up.
You: <shake>WHAT?</shake>
Frankie: Kidding! <wiggle>Prankssss</wiggle>.
You: Okay... seriously... do you know where it is?
Frankie: No, but go find Victor. He used to bake with her all the time. Fair warning, he's a creepy dude, though.
You: ...you're a ghost. That's kinda creepy.
Frankie: Victor is different. He smells like hot garbage and toe jam.
Frankie: He is funny, though. One time he disappeared for a decade. Weird joke, but hilarious.
// You: By the way, we're selling the house...
// Frankie: Hilarious!
// You: No, really.
// Frankie: Wow. Dang. I guess it’ll be time for me to move on then.
// You: I’m sorry.
// Frankie: GOTCHA. <wiggle>Pranks!</wiggle> I’m staying here forever!
Frankie: Anyway, if your nose hairs are tingling, you're getting closer.
You: Is... my Grandma a ghost here?
Frankie: Awk-ward. No, Grammy G isn’t here.
Frankie: But, it's a good thing, kid! It means she had no unfinished business.
// Frankie: Can you imagine? Maybe I’d be able to eat those cookies instead of just smelling them.
You: Oh. Good. Well I’m gonna go look for the recipe.
Frankie: Don't trip and die! You'll be stuck here forever!
You: What?
Frankie: Joking! <wiggle>Prankssss</wiggle>.

Narration: They look so young. So happy. You wonder if they look the same now that they’re back together... Uh... you'd rather not think about that, actually...
Narration: There’s a stack of photo albums littered on the floor.
Narration: Grandma always said you looked like your grandfather. You always said you looked more like her.
Narration: Floating over an open photo album is another ghost.

<<set_active_character Edith>>
<<play_sfx GhostFadeIn>>
Edith: You’re not here to take the albums, are you?
You: I will eventually.
Edith: Then I’d like one last look at them. I like admiring another photographer's craft. Plus, Grammy G looks so happy in these.
-> Are you happy?
    Edith: Rude question. I'm a ghost. I make do.
-> Are you a photographer?
    Edith: Oh, yes, I was known for my bird photography.
    You: That's cool. What type of birds?
    Edith: Pigeons.
    You: ...just pigeons?
    Edith: Of course not! But I thought they were <rainb>majestic</rainb>.
    You: So you were the pigeon photographer?
    Edith: I told you- I photographed other birds too!
    You: ...
    Edith: But yeah, I was known as the pigeon photographer.
Edith: Did you come in here for something?
You: Oh, right. I'm looking for her cookie recipe.
Edith: It won't be in here. That'll be with Victor.
You: Toe jam smelling dude?
Edith: That's the one!
You: Can't wait.
Edith: ...Gosh, I can’t find anything around here. I can’t even find my camera!
You: The one around your neck?
Edith: No, no. It was a different one with a longer lens.
You: When did you last see it?
Edith: Twenty years ago.
You: ...Oh.
Edith: I miss it.
You: ...
You: I miss her.
Edith: She was beautiful in photos. These photos? Yuck... I could have captured it better.
Edith: But honestly, she made even the blurry ones look good.
Edith: I’m trying to say that I'm sorry for your loss.
You: ... Thanks.
Edith: You know, Grammy G was always good at comforting me when I’d lose things. Want me to try?
You: Sure?
Edith: Okay, here we go. *pat pat* Feel better?
You: No, now I'm cold.
Edith: Sorry. One of the downsides of being a ghost. Well, good luck finding the recipe.
You: Thanks. Good luck finding your camera.
Edith: No, that one is long gone. But we all need to move on eventually.
You: That was oddly comforting.

Narration: The landscaping brings a smile to your face. You remember cleaning pinecones out of the yard.
Narration: Did she just need a helping hand or was it an excuse to spend time together outside?
Narration: At the corner of your eye, a bush rustles. Another cool gust of wind and a ghost appears.

Narration: You look around the garden. Most things are wilted, even the cacti.
You: Dang, what happened here?
Gertrude: I tried keeping up the garden, but I don’t have the green thumb like Grammy G did. I don’t really have thumbs at all anymore! Hehehe.
You: What have you tried planting?
Gertrude: Do you know beets?
You: Yeah, she would pickle beets for us as kids!
Gertrude: Well not those.
You: Oh.
Gertrude: I’m trying to grow these blueberries that she would mix in her cookies.

Gertrude: Not at all! She used this one all the time! It was her favorite!
You: Is it helping you with your gardening?
Gertrude: No, I don't think it works.
You: It doesn’t help that you’re holding it upside down.
Gertrude: You know, I thought it had a wide handle.
-> Did you help Grandma garden?
    Gertrude: Sometimes I killed things.
    You: Well, that doesn’t seem helpful.
    Gertrude: It wasn't on purpose! Apparently ectoplasm isn’t good for plants.
    You: Gross!
    Gertrude: No one told me!
-> How long have you been here?
    Gertrude: I'm the newest! It's why I try to earn my keep by tending the veggies.
    You: You're doing... great.
    Gertrude: Want some lettuce?
    You: NO. I mean... no. Thank you.
    Gertrude: That's good. Cause it's dead, anyway.
    You: Oh, it looks like that one is still living!
    Gertrude: That one is fake. I needed a goal to work towards.
You: Have you gotten anything to live?
Gertrude: Well... no. Not really. Actually, never.
You: ...
Gertrude: But ya know, your grandmother was always patient with me!
You: Yeah... me too...
Gertrude: Victor is not nearly as patient... Says he needs blueberries for those cookies and QUICK.
Gertrude: Like, geez, <wiggle>I'm working on it, Victor!</wiggle>
You: Oh, he knows how to bake them?
Gertrude: Yep, he baked with Grammy G all the time. If anyone knows about your cookies, he would.
You: Do you know where I could find him?
Gertrude: Just keep looking. He'll be lurking in some <wave>dark corner</wave> of the house.
You: Well, thanks for the tip. I'll keep an eye out.

You: I want her back. I miss the late nights watching horror movies, the early morning breakfasts with coffee... heck, I miss the way she laughed.
Victor: Yeah, that was nice. With the little snort at the end?
You: Yes!
Victor: Sometimes with snot!
You: Hah... yeah.
Victor: Well, this recipe won't bring that back, I'm afraid.
